# bash-common :computer:

## What is this repo?

This repo is a collection of linux admin and bash scripting.

#### This repo is broken down into two sections.

1. The common section is linux basics + light bash programming.
    * This section contains things like:
        * `whoami`
        * `chmod`
        * `ls`
2. The scripts section is my collection of handy scripts that meet two criteria:
    * I use regularly or semi-regularly.
    * They are longer than 1 line or contain a less than trivial amount of complexity.

## Motivation:

I use a Mac everyday at work and while I can manage I don't have a resource that I personally :heart:. This repo aims to be a bash and linux reference that I love.

This repo will be mine and so as I find things that are super useful to me they will be added here. I hope that other people also dig them.

I will do my best to make the repo easily searchable. Feel free to post a little linux nugget if you find it.
