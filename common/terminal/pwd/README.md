# Print Working Directory (`pwd`)

The `pwd` command will print the directory you are currently in.

It has two optional flags: `--logical` (`-L`) and `--physical` (`-P`) default behavior is `-P`

The difference between logical and physical is adherence to symlinks. See advanced usage script for more details. ([symbolic links](https://www.nixtutor.com/freebsd/understanding-symbolic-links/))
